# Clicky-Game (React app)

This is a react-based memory game. Cards are shuffled and displayed on screen every time the game starts and when the user clicks on one of them. If the user clicks on the same image twice, the game ends. Otherwise, the score keeps going up. The started code was created using the command:

```
create react app
```
